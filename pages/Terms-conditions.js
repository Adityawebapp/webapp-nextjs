              including, but not limited to, any previous versions of the Terms
              of Use. The following Terms of Use, despite the previous
              provision, only apply to the extent that any terms set forth
              expressly contradict any terms of a prior written agreement
              between you and Webapp.{" "}
            </p>

              When you use other Webapp services, you also may be subject to
              additional terms and conditions that may apply third-party content
              or third-party software. The Terms of Use must not be assigned by
              you or otherwise transfer or any right granted hereunder.

            <p>
              Webapp`s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of

              of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. It is your
              responsibility to file any claim or cause of action arising out of
